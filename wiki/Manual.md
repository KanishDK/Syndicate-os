## 1. Getting Started

### The Golden Triangle
Success requires mastering three interconnected systems:

**PRODUCE** → **SELL** → **LAUNDER** → **INVEST** → **REPEAT**

- **Dirty Money**: Earned from illegal sales. Cannot be used to buy upgrades or legal assets.
- **Clean Money**: Laundered profits. Used to buy staff, upgrades, and territories.
- **Heat**: The price of doing business. Manage it or face raids.

### First Steps
1. **Produce Hash**: Click "Lav Hash" to start manual production.
2. **Sell Products**: Click "Sælg Alt" or enable auto-sell to earn Dirty Money.
3. **Launder Money**: Use "Vaskeriet" to convert dirty cash to clean cash.
4. **Hire Staff**: Automate your operations.
5. **Manage Heat**: Keep it below 80% to avoid police attention.
