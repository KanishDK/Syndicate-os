## 1. Core Systems

### 1.1 Economy (Clean vs Dirty Money)

**The Dual Currency System**:
- **Dirty Money** (Sorte Penge): Earned from illegal sales.
  - Generates heat when accumulated.
  - Cannot be used for official upgrades/staff.
- **Clean Money** (Rene Penge): Laundered profit or territory income.
  - Safe to use for all purchases.
  - Does not generate heat.

### 1.2 Production System

**12 Product Tiers**:
From Hash (Tier 1) to Fentanyl (Tier 4). Higher tiers offer massive revenue but generate significant Heat and require expensive base materials.

---

## 2. Progression

### 2.1 XP & Leveling
Level up to unlock new staff, missions, and territories. 
- **XP Sources**: Missions (Primary), Sales (Secondary), Territory Conquest.
- **Max Level**: Rank 10+ unlocks the final narrative closure.

### 3.3 Strategic Control Grid (Rivals Tab)
A unified interface to monitor your dominance over Copenhagen's districts.
- **Status Indicators**: Neutral, Locked (Level requirement), Operative (Owned), or **BESAT** (Occupied by Rivals).
- **Rival Occupation**: If hostility is high, rivals can seize your territories, blocking income. Use the **"Befri Område"** (Liberate Area) action to reclaim them.
- **Global Dominance**: Track your percentage of total territory control.

### 3.4 Deep Stats (Network/Management Tab)
- **Click-to-Expand**: Instead of simple hover text, you can now CLICK on territories and staff cards to see detailed breakdowns of IPS, production rates, and salary costs. This is optimized for both desktop and mobile.
