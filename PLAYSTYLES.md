## 🏃 SPEEDRUN GUIDE (v1.1.2 Optimized)
*Goal: Reach Gudfader (Rank 7) ASAP.*

1. **Tutorial Blitz**: Complete M1-M4 in under 5 mins.
2. **Hash Hustle**: Ignore upgrades, focus purely on output until Rank 2.
3. **Staden Entry**: Use Sultan's bribe choice to take Staden with 0 heat.
4. **Coke Flip**: Invest all clean cash from territories into Cocaine production for the final XP push.

## 💎 PLATINUM KINGPIN (End-Game)
*Goal: 100% Control Grid and Infinite Money Sink.*

### 1. The Diamond Grind
- Active play is key to catching **Golden Drones**.
- Save Diamonds for **Mastery Perks**:
  - Priority 1: **Ghost Operations** (Stability).
  - Priority 2: **Titan Produktion** (Scaling).

### 2. Luxury Investment Order
- **Penthouse (5M)**: Buy this first. The 50% XP bonus makes Rank 10+ much faster.
- **Super Yacht (25M)**: Essential for cleaning the massive dirty cash flows of the endgame.
- **Gulfstream G650 (100M)**: Allows you to scale production without triggering constant SWAT raids.
- **Privat Ø (500M)**: The ultimate trophy. Makes you "Untouchable" (20% Heat Cap).

### 3. Territory Warfare
- **Liberation**: If a Rival takes a territory, liberate it immediately. Losing a high-level area like Hellerup or City can crash your IPS (Income Per Second). 
- **Sabotage**: Use Sabotage in the Rivals tab to lower hostility before they strike.

---

## 🌙 CASUAL IDLE
*Goal: Passive expansion.*

1. **Automation**: Maximize **Pushers** and **Gartnere** early.
2. **Offshore Logic**: Invest in the **Accountant** early to wash money while offline.
3. **Territory Growth**: Upgrade territory levels evenly to maximize IPS (Income Per Second).

## 🏆 ACHIEVEMENT TIPS
- **Escobar**: Pair with **Titan Produktion** mastery for 15% faster completion.
- **Untouchable**: The **Private Island** luxury item auto-completes this challenge.
